- Create WIRES class to work on wires
- Add BUS::reset
- The current problem is figuring out how to reset wires when they are used bi-directionally.
  - Attach both input and output of a register to a bus
  - Write on the bus
  - Set the e bit of the register
    - Bus is not reset (because the va;ue inside the register was not changed so there is no updated data
        to propagate along the wires)
  - Maybe bus resets before setting e are the solution?

Ex:
use strict ;
use RAM ;
use Algorithm::Combinatorics qw(tuples_with_repetition) ;


my $bus = new BUS() ;
my $ws = new WIRE() ;
my $we = new WIRE() ;
my @ios = map { PASS->thru($_) } $bus->wires() ;

# Now we create the circuit
my $R = new REGISTER("RAM(xy)") ;
$ws->connect($R->s()) ;
$we->connect($R->e()) ;
$bus->connect([$R->is()], [$R->os()]) ;

warn $R->show() ;
$bus->power("10101010") ;
warn $R->show() ;
$GATES::DEBUG = 1 ;
$we->power(1) ;
warn $we->power() ;
warn $ws->power() ;
warn $R->show() ;
