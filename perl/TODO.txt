- Add DEBUG instruction to ASM
  - Not clear how to do that yet... 
  - Code must serialized along with the instructions in the ASM file, recorded when the directive is run
    - ... and involked when the referring instruction is executed...

- ASM: Implement LABELs and GOTOs to simplify branching and looping

Organize programs:
- jcscpu.pl reads and interprets machine code (instructions)
- jcsasm.pl reads assembly code DSL (a Perl file) and produces machine code
- jcshll.pl read HLL code DSL (a Perl file) and produces machine code
